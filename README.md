### Booleans
  - **Booleans** are values that can be only one of two things: `true` or `false`.
  - Are essential for conditional statements to work.
    - ***Logical operators***
    - `&&`: *And* is used with two or more values (operands), and only evaluates to true if all the operands are truthful.
    - `||`: *OR* is used with two or more values, but it evaluates to true if any of the operands (values) are true, so only evaluates to false if both operands are false.
    - `!`: *Not* Using the ! operator in front of a value will convert it to a Boolean and return an opposite value. It means that a true value will return false, and a false will return true.
